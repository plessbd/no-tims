                The proposed Tim Hortons location at <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">8503 Main Street, at the corner of Main and Harris Hill</strong>, raises significant concerns for our community.

                Councilman Casilio's Inconsistent Stance
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-300">
                A disturbing element in this discussion is the apparent inconsistency in Councilman Casilio's position on such developments.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2 leading-relaxed pl-4 dark:text-gray-300">
                <li>
                    In 2014, Councilman Casilio vocally opposed a similar Tim Hortons proposal at 8250 Main Street (approximately 0.2 miles from his residence). He explicitly voiced concerns that "<strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">60 customers or more</strong>" would cause a "traffic jam" on Westwood Road (<a href="https://www4.erie.gov/clarence/sites/www4.erie.gov.clarence/files/2023-02/ws-tb_5-14-14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Clarence Town Board Minutes, 05/14/14</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The current proposal at 8503 Main Street projects almost double that traffic (114 vehicle trips), at an intersection far more dangerous and congested than the site he previously opposed. Yet, there seems to be less opposition from him on this significantly higher-impact project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding to the irony, Councilman Casilio has stated, "The Town of Clarence is not in the development business... that area is zoned for a coffee shop. The owner... has a right to ask to open up a coffee business there." This statement contrasts with the fact that he himself owns <a href="https://casilioco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">CasilioCo.com</a>, a property development company.
