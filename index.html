            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The proposed Tim Hortons location at <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">8503 Main Street, at the corner of Main and Harris Hill</strong>, raises significant concerns for our community. This is not just about another coffee shop; it's about the profound impact on an already strained intersection and the safety of our residents, especially children.

                    The Main and Harris Hill intersection is a hazardous 5-point configuration, already problematic for both state and county authorities due to existing traffic congestion.

                    Alarmingly, the sidewalks at this intersection are frequently driven on by vehicles, creating dangerous conditions. There have been multiple documented instances where children, even with a dedicated crossing guard present, have been nearly struck by cars navigating this unsafe intersection.

                Councilman Casilio's Inconsistent Stance
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                A disturbing element in this discussion is the apparent inconsistency in Councilman Casilio's position on such developments.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-2 leading-relaxed pl-4">
                <li>
                    In 2014, Councilman Casilio vocally opposed a similar Tim Hortons proposal at 8250 Main Street (approximately 0.2 miles from his residence). He explicitly voiced concerns that "<strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">60 customers or more</strong>" would cause a "traffic jam" on Westwood Road (<a href="https://www4.erie.gov/clarence/sites/www4.erie.gov.clarence/files/2023-02/ws-tb_5-14-14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Clarence Town Board Minutes, 05/14/14</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The current proposal at 8503 Main Street projects almost double that traffic (114 vehicle trips), at an intersection far more dangerous and congested than the site he previously opposed. Yet, there seems to be less opposition from him on this significantly higher-impact project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding to the irony, Councilman Casilio has stated, "The Town of Clarence is not in the development business... that area is zoned for a coffee shop. The owner... has a right to ask to open up a coffee business there." This statement contrasts with the fact that he himself owns <a href="https://casilioco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">CasilioCo.com</a>, a property development company.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This inconsistency undermines public trust. It is precisely the job of elected representatives to advocate for their constituents, ensure that laws and zoning benefit the community, and to initiate or support changes to regulations when existing rules lead to detrimental outcomes like this. Our elected officials must demonstrate transparency, accountability, and consistent leadership, applying the same standards across all community areas.
